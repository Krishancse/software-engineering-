9. **Command-Line Skills**:
   - Familiarity with the command line for tasks like running scripts, using version control, and managing dependencies.

10. **Debugging and Troubleshooting**:
    - Ability to identify and fix software bugs, including proficiency in using debugging tools.

11. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
    - Understanding of OOP concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism) and design patterns.

12. **Security Awareness**:
    - Basic knowledge of security best practices in software development, including input validation and data encryption.

13. **Front-End Skills** (for front-end roles):
    - Proficiency in CSS preprocessors (e.g., SASS) and build tools (e.g., Webpack).
    - Knowledge of responsive web design and accessibility.

14. **Cloud Computing**:
    - Familiarity with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud can be advantageous, especially for projects involving cloud services.

### Soft Skills:
